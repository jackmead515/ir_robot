# ir_robot

Although it may seem rather simple at first, each of the values you see listed in the "if else" clauses took some time to discover.

However, it's not very complicated. With a simple tv remote controller, all you have to do is press a button and point it at the 
IR sensor and print the value out to the screen! 

Use different remotes for each robot you use, otherwise, well, it won't be a lot of fun when every is controlling everyone else's robot :P
